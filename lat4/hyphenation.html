	<h1>Hyphenation</h1>
	<h2>Mandatory for justified text; optional otherwise</h2>
	
	<br>

	<div class="kiri">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyphenation is the automated process of breaking words
		between lines to create more consistency across a text block.
		In justified text, hyphenation is mandatory.
		In left-aligned text, hyphenation evens the irregular right
		edge of the text, called the rag. Hyphenation is optional for
		left-aligned text because the rag will still be somewhat irregular, even with hyphenation. Hyphenation doesn’t improve text legibility. In this case, consider turning it off.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;As line length gets shorter, hyphenation becomes essential.
		Why? With hyphenation off, your word processor or web
		browser can only break lines at word spaces. As the lines
		get shorter, there are fewer words and hence fewer possible break points in each line, making awkward breaks more
		likely.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;In word processors, you can exert rudimentary control
		over automatic hyphenation. If you’re curious, search your
		help file for “hyphenation options.” 
	</div>

	<div class="kanan">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, I’ve never touched these, so I doubt you’ll
		need to either. The nonbreaking hyphen and the optional
		hyphen solve most hyphenation problems, and even those
		are pretty rare.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;In pro page-layout programs, you can exert a lot of control
		over automatic hyphenation (usually in conjunction with
		justification, so all the settings together are known as H&Js).
		In web browsers, you can exert almost no control over automatic hyphenation, so if you use CSS hyphenation, be prepared for some clunkers.
		&nbsp;&nbsp;If you’re using a web content-management system like
		WordPress, an alternative hyphenation method is to use a
		plugin that puts soft hyphens (aka optional hyphens) in the
		text. Soft hyphens are well supported in web browsers, even
		browsers that don’t support CSS hyphenation (e.g., desktop
		Chrome). This also allows somewhat more control over
		hyphenation. But it’s more work. If your project demands
		full justification, this might be worth it. Otherwise, probably not.

			<li>A hyphen appears at the end of a line when a word breaks onto the next line. These hyphens are added and removed automatically by the automatic hyphenation in your word processor or web browser.</li><br>
			<li>Some multipart words are spelled with a hyphen (topsy-turvy, cost-effective, bric-a-brac). But a prefix is not typically followed with a hyphen (nonprofit, not non-profit).</li><br>
			<li>A hyphen is used in phrasal adjectives (listener-supported radio, dog-and-pony show, highschool grades) to ensure clarity. Nonprofessional writers often omit these hyphens. As a professional writer, you should not. For instance, consider the unhyphenated phrase five dollar bills. Is five the quantity of dollar bills, or are the bills each worth five dollars? As written, it suggests the former. If you mean the latter, then you’d write five-dollar bills.</li><br>
		</ol>

	<div class="tengah2">
		<b><i>[Note: No hyphen is necessary in phrasal adjectives that begin
		with an adverb ending in ‑ly (it’s a closely held company, not a
		closely-held company). Nor is a hyphen necessary in multipart
		foreign terms or proper names used as adjectives (habeas corpus
		appeal on the Third Circuit docket, not habeas-corpus appeal on
		the Third-Circuit docket).]</i></b>
	</div>

	<div class="tengah">
		<br><br>Dashes come in two sizes—the en dash and the em dash. The em dash (—) is typically about as wide as a capital H. The en dash (–) is about half as wide. En and em dashes are often approximated by typing two or three hyphens in a row (-- or --- ). Don’t do that—it’s another typewriter habit. Use real dashes.<br><br>
		<b><i>The en dash has two uses.</i></b>

			<li>It indicates a range of values (1880–1912, pages 330–39, Exhibits A–E). If you open with from, pair it with to instead of an en dash (from 1880 to 1912, not from 1880–1912).</li><br>
			<li>It denotes a connection or contrast between pairs of words (conservative–liberal split, Arizona–Nevada reciprocity, Sarbanes–Oxley Act).</li><br>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<div class="tengah2">
		<b><i>The em dash is used to make a break between parts of a sentence.
		Use it when a comma is too weak, but a colon, semicolon, or pair
		of parentheses is too strong. The em dash puts a nice pause in the
		text—and it is underused in professional writing.<br><br>
		[End note] By The Way</i></b><br><br>
	</div>

	<div class="kiri optimafont">
		- Don’t use a slash ( / ) where an en dash
		is correct.<br>
		- Even though the en dash is used for joint
		authors (Sarbanes–Oxley Act), use a hyphen for compound names. If the son
		and daughter of Sarbanes and Oxley married, they’d be known as Mr. & Mrs. Sarbanes-Oxley (with a hyphen), not Mr. &
		Mrs. Sarbanes–Oxley (with an en dash).-
		Em and en dashes are typically set flush
		against the surrounding text. Some fonts
		include a little white space around the em
		dash; some don’t. If your em dashes look
		like they’re being crushed—particularly if
		you’re setting type on screen—it’s fine to
		add word spaces before and after.<br>
		- An en dash makes an acceptable minus
		sign in spreadsheets or mathematical expressions. 
	</div>

	<div class="kanan optimafont">
		- Em and en refer to units of typographic
		measurement, not to the letters M and N.
		(Yes, the homophony is confusing. To disambiguate, loud print shops referred to
		them as mutton and nut.) In a traditional
		metal font, the em was the vertical distance
		from the top of a piece of type to the bottom. The en was half the size of the em.
		Originally, the width of the em and en<br>
		dashes corresponded to these units. In today’s digital fonts, they run narrower.
		- Fans of Robert Bringhurst’s book The Elements of Typographic Style (and I am
		among them—see bibliography) may know
		that he recommends using en dashes with
		spaces rather than em dashes. Perhaps this
		practice is common in Mr. Bringhurst’s native Canada. But in American typography,
		it’s not.
